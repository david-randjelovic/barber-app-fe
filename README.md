This Angular Barber Shop Application is an open-source project designed to showcase my Angular skills. It's a personal application intended for a specific barber shop, featuring a single admin user and several user roles. This project works in tandem with a Laravel-based backend, showcasing my Laravel skills as well.

## Features

- **Appointment Booking:** Users can book appointments.
- **Simple service dropdown:** Pick the haircut style you'd.
- **News Catalog:** Browse through barbers new posts.
- **Admin Dashboard:** For the barber shop owner to manage appointments and services.
